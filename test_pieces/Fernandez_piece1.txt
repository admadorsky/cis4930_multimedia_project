It was a warm evening, about 74 degrees with slight humidity, but it didn't matter.
It might as well have been 29 and snowing. He felt the cozy cold chill of the
Winter season and the warmth of the Christmas spirit. He felt very happy.
Although there was
plenty of finals work to complete before he would truly be free at the end of the
semester, and that looming workload dampened his spirit, he still felt hopeful for
the coming weeks.
His mind wanders to places of responsibilities and shortcomings, and those
worry him. But who doesn't worry about those things? Enjoying life isn't about
toiling to remove all the pain from it; that's a battle loss before it even started. Life
is finding happiness where it can found and latching on to them with more
passion and care than the bad.
It wasn't much of a story, but it was human. It was his thoughts as he sat at his
desk typing a test script for a project. He was the author of this paper. Merry
Christmas!
